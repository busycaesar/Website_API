# Website APIs (In Dev.)

## Description

Website API is a comprehensive platform designed to simplify access to data from various developer platforms using a single interface. By securely storing users' API keys, our application allows users to fetch and manage their content from platforms like GitHub and Dev.to seamlessly. Users can retrieve their repositories, contributions, and articles through our unified API, making it easier to integrate and display content from multiple sources.

This project aims to streamline content management for developers, reducing the complexity of handling multiple APIs and enhancing productivity. With robust security measures in place, users can trust that their API keys are handled safely, ensuring privacy and data protection. Explore the power of centralized content access with the Website API.
